## 🎯 Advantages of This Approach

1. **Simple**: No separate table needed
2. **Fast**: One query updates all employees
3. **Consistent**: All employees always see the same message
4. **No Migration**: Uses existing Employee Directory table
5. **Easy Backup**: Announcement data is part of employee records

## 🔍 How Dismissal Works

### Local Storage
```typescript
localStorage.setItem('dismissed-announcement', Date.now().toString())
```

### 24-Hour Timer
- When user clicks ✕, timestamp is stored
- On page load, check if 24 hours passed
- If yes, clear dismissal and show banner again
- If admin creates new announcement, dismissal is cleared

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Banner Not Showing

**Check 1**: Does Employee Directory have `Announcement` field?
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT column_name 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'Employee Directory' 
  AND column_name = 'Announcement';
```

**Check 2**: Do employees have status = 'Active'?
```sql
SELECT full_name, status, Announcement 
FROM "Employee Directory" 
WHERE status = 'Active' 
LIMIT 5;
```

**Check 3**: Is announcement data valid JSON?
```sql
SELECT full_name, Announcement 
FROM "Employee Directory" 
WHERE Announcement IS NOT NULL 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Can't Create Announcement

**Check RLS Policies**: Ensure your user can update Employee Directory
```sql
-- Check if RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'Employee Directory';
```

### Changes Not Appearing

1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.removeItem('dismissed-announcement')`
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify database was updated

## 📊 Database Query Examples

### See All Employee Announcements
```sql
SELECT full_name, status, Announcement 
FROM "Employee Directory" 
WHERE status = 'Active';
```

### Manually Set Announcement for All
```sql
UPDATE "Employee Directory"
SET Announcement = '{"type":"motivation","title":"Test","message":"Hello everyone!"}'
WHERE status = 'Active';
```

### Clear All Announcements
```sql
UPDATE "Employee Directory"
SET Announcement = NULL
WHERE status = 'Active';
```

### Count Employees with Announcement
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_employees,
       COUNT(Announcement) as employees_with_announcement
FROM "Employee Directory"
WHERE status = 'Active';
```
